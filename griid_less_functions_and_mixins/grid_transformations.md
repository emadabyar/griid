# Grid transformations

Note: *all transformation functions check markup, not styling*. When you target `.griid-x` grids with a certain column count, griid targets *ostensible* column counts, disregarding any transformations you may have done. For example: If you use  `.griid--drop-one(5);` to turn a five-column grid into four-column grid ([see below](https://github.com/olets/griid#3-adjusting-griid-x-cell-grids)) and later want to turn it into a three-column grid, you'll need to do either `.griid--drop(2,5)` ("drop by 2 the column count of 5-column grids") or `.griid--resize-one(3,5)` ("resize to 3 columns all 5-column grids"). Don't be tricked into thinking you can do `.griid--drop-one(4)` - as far as `.griid--drop-one()` is concerned, this is still a `.griid-5`. Similarly, `.griid--drop; .griid-drop` is no different than `.griid--drop`. In practice this isn't a problem - there are enough options that you'll be able to easily do what you want.
