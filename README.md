# griid
Griid is an easy-to-use grid system which supports three grid types: single full-width single-row grids  with cells of equal width; multi-row grids with a specified number of equal-width columns; and multi-row grids with fraction-of-the-grid-width cell widths specified per-cell. In the latter two cases, if the last row of the grid isn't filled its cells will be center aligned
