In the latter two cases, if the last row of the grid isn't filled its cells will be center aligned\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n1. Three types of rows are supported\r\n\r\n  A.\tAutomatic equal-width cells, filling one entire row.\r\n\r\n\t\t<div class=\"griid\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cell\">1-</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cell\">2-</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cell\">3-</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t|\t  1-\t  |\t  2-\t  |\t  3-\t  |\r\n\r\n\r\n\tB. Automatic equal-width cells, with a specified number of columns per row.\r\n\r\n\t\t<div class=\"griid-COUNT\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cell\">...</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cell\">...</div>\r\n\t\t\t...\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\twhere COUNT is an integer between 2 and @griid-max_equal_columns (inclusive). All cells will be the same width, 1/COUNT the width of the row.\r\n\r\n\tFor example:\r\n\r\n\t\t<div class=\"griid-2\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cell\">1</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cell\">2</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cell\">3</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t|\t\t  1\t\t  |\t\t  2\t\t  |\r\n\t\t\t\t|\t\t  3\t\t  |\r\n\r\n\r\n\tC. Cell fractional width specified on a per-column basis, with under-full rows aligned centered.\r\n\r\n\t\t<div class=\"griid\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cell-X-N\">...</div>\r\n\t\t\t...\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\twhere X is an integer less than N,\r\n\tand N is an integer between 2 and `@griid-min_fractional_width` (inclusive).\r\n\tCells will be X/N the width of the row. Cells' widths are independent of each other.\r\n\r\n\t!Important: Because the styles don't know what cell widths you've used, you must add `.row-end` to the last cell of each row\r\n\r\n\t\t<div class=\"griid\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cell-1-4\">1</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cell-1-2\">2</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cell-1-4 row-end\">3</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cell-1-3\">2</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t|\t 1\t |\t\t  2\t\t  |\t 3\t |\r\n   \t\t            |      4     |\r\n\r\n\tFull-width cells are cell-N-N or `cell-full`, and do not require `row-end`\r\n\r\n\r\n2. For A and B, columns are separated by \r\n\r\n\r\n3. In all cases,\r\n\t\r\n\tCells are separated by the griid-cell_spacing value,\r\n\t\r\n\tCells are vertically centered.\r\n\t- Add `.top` or `.bottom` to a column to customize its vertical alignment\r\n\t- Add `.top` or `.bottom` to a row or row group to customize the default for its child columns\r\n\t- Override upstream up customizations by adding `.top`, `.middle`, or `.bottom` to a row or column\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgements:\r\nThis started as a modification of Joel Sutherland's \"grid-items\" grid system","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
